# Image-Classification-Project
This project focuses on classifying images into different categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated based on accuracy and performance metrics.

# Features
* Image preprocessing using OpenCV (resizing, normalization).
* CNN model training on custom or pre-defined datasets.
* Evaluation of model performance.
* Visualization of results with confusion matrix and accuracy plots.

# Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
